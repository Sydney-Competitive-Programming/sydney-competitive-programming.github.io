### Introduction
As this is a new group, the meetup structure will be pretty dynamic to start with. This is a chance for you to help shape what you want from this meetup and how you think it is best run! So please give us your feedback and we develop a structure that's best for us all.

What you can expect from the event is:

1. MICRO-TALK & INTRODUCTION: We will start the event with an introduction to the coordinators, discuss the rules and introduce the challenges for the day. In the future we will be getting the community to present on things such as their favourite packages, design practices and quirks of certain languages.

2. MICRO-HACKATHON: Next we will split off and begin to develop our solutions. You can work on your own, or band together into teams to solve problems together.

3. PRESENTATIONS & NETWORKING: Finally we will present our solutions to one another, crown a winner and come together to meet and chat. This is a social meetup remember!

You will need to bring with you your own laptop, but we are happy to help you set up your development environment for newbies. This event is for all skill levels. Don't feel intimidated if you are new to coding!

Welcome to our meetup!

Special thanks to General Assembly, who've offered up some space at their campus to run our meetup, as we now have a home to host our events.
